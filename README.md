# My Custom Hyprland DE
A complete set of dotfiles and an installation script for a personalized, glass-themed Hyprland desktop on Arch Linux. This setup is designed to be minimal, aesthetically pleasing, and functional for a development and electronics workflow. üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®

## ‚ú® Features

- Modern Hyprland Setup: A fast, fluid, and customizable Wayland compositor.
- Unified Frosted Glass Theme: A consistent blur effect across the Waybar, terminal (Kitty), and application launcher (Wofi).

- Lightweight & Performant: All components are chosen for their speed and low resource usage.

- Pre-configured Keybinds: Sensible shortcuts for launching apps, managing windows, and controlling the system.

- Automated Installation: A single command to deploy the entire environment on a fresh Arch Linux install.

## Core Components

This desktop environment is built by combining several individual components, each with a specific purpose:

| Component | Software Used |	Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component | Software Used | Purpose |
| Window Manager | Hyprland | The core that draws and manages all windows. |
| Status Bar | Waybar | "Displays workspaces, system info, time, etc." |
| Application Launcher | Wofi | "A fast, keyboard-driven menu to launch apps." |
| Wallpaper Manager | Waypaper | A GUI tool for setting and managing wallpapers. |
| Terminal Emulator | Kitty | "A fast, feature-rich | GPU-accelerated terminal."|
| File Manager | Dolphin | The default file manager. |
| Screenshot Tool | grim + slurp | Lightweight utilities for capturing the screen. |
| Screenshot Editor | swappy | A simple tool for editing screenshots. |
|Audio/Bluetooth Control | pavucontrol/blueman | GUI tools for managing audio and Bluetooth devices.|

## Installation Guide

The process is two steps: performing a minimal Arch Linux installation, then running the deployment script.


### Step 1: Base Arch Linux Installation
First, follow the official Arch Linux installation guide. When you install packages with pacstrap, you only need a minimal set of tools.

Your pacstrap command should look something like this:

```bash
# pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware networkmanager git nano
```

### Important:
- You must install git to be able to clone repositories.

- You must install a network manager like NetworkManager to have internet access after rebooting.

- You do not need to install audio (pipewire) or Bluetooth (bluez) packages. The installation script will handle this automatically.

#### Step 2: Run the Correct Installation Commands

Now, on the machine where you are trying to install your DE, follow the new instructions. If you've already run the script partway, that's okay. Just delete the folder if it exists (`rm -rf My-Hyprland-DE`) and start fresh.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priyanshu643/My-Hyprland-DE.git
    ```
2.  **Enter the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd My-Hyprland-DE/my-hyprland-de
    ```
3.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

Now, because you are running `./install.sh` from *inside* the project folder, it will be able to see the `hypr`, `waybar`, `kitty` folders right next to it, and the `cp` commands will succeed.

You've successfully evolved your project from a simple script to a full-fledged dotfiles repository. This is the standard and correct way to manage and share a setup like this!
