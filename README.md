## üöÄ Installation Guide

The process is two steps: performing a minimal Arch Linux installation, then running the deployment script.

### Step 1: Base Arch Linux Installation

First, follow the official Arch Linux installation guide. When you install packages with `pacstrap`, you only need a minimal set of tools.

Your `pacstrap` command should look something like this:
```bash
# pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware networkmanager git nano
